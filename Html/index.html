            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

                Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small
                children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school
                and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a
                college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where
                they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians,
                builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical
                experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this, </p>
